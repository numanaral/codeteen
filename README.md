## Session 1: Basics, General structure of html and css
- Make them clear out the unnecessary items created by default (if you are using glitch)
	- Briefly explain html, head and body 
- What are tags?
	- Give an example using Paragraph
	- Explain new paragraph vs new line (br within p VS new p)
- Tag attributes
	- Explain it in the simplest form
	- Move onto the examples to show how it works every time you require a new attribute in a tag
- Styling
	- Use very basic style properties that are easy to understand as their name suggests
		- color
		- background
		- font-size
			- Explain px (and only use px for now)
	- Give examples of 3 different way of styling
		- Inline (within the tag)
		- Internal (using \<style> in the head section)
		- External (using \<link> using the style.css file)
			- Explain href
	- Talk about what "convention" means
		- Tell them about the importance of following conventions
		- Explain the importance of separating code into different sections of its own
		> I ended up styling within the head tag purely because they get to see both the html and the css at the same time
- Style selectors
	- Regular, class (.), id (#) - Don't go more advanced than this yet
	- Explain using examples why you would choose one over the other
		> Talk about working smart as we are all lazy people
- More tags
	- Division: Very important
		- We will use this to talk about our second next point
	- Button: Create a simple button with no style
		- Talk about before adding a text vs after text
	- Anchor:
		- Talk about before adding a text vs after text vs after href
			- href="" vs href="#" vs href="something.else"
- Advanced style if you are good with time, if not, talk about at least one
	- .class vs tag.class
		- Using an example show how this works and why you would use it
- CSS Box Model
	> Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
	> 
	> Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
	> 
	> Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
	> 
	> Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
	
	- This is very important, make sure to explain it well using the whiteboard
	- Talk about 3 ways of styling (margin/padding: 4 params vs 2 params vs 1 param)
- If you still have time, explain more of the "CORE" tags
	- Title: Show it working in a separate tab running the app
	- DOCTYPE: Talk about what this defines
	- Meta: Talk about very basic meta tags
	- Explain how they wont have to memorize any of these and how they will end up using boilerplates
- Before you finish up, talk about the importance of this programme
	- Tell them how important coding projects are when you are seeking a position in the future
	- Explain to them the benefit of starting at such an early age
	- Tell them how awesome this(*) will actually look in their resume/cv/portfolio
		- The website they will create by the end of 9 hours
